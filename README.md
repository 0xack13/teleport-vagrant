# teleport-vagrant

Vagrant file only to run teleport proxy:

```bash
vagrant up
```

Currently supports Virtualbox only. However, the DNS records will be populated in the hosts file.

You can access the invitation link from the `invitevagrant.txt` file and the Teleport portal will show the other 2 nodes.

Enjoy!
